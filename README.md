This is a small javascript web application that was built with typescript.  At the end of the day, this application uses .js files transpiled by typescript.  In order for that typescript to be transpiled, typescript rules need to be followed, making typescript a useful tool to make web applications more maintainable and cleaner.

To run the demo application:

1. open up Terminal or PowerShell or Command Prompt and navigate to the root of the application (dir where the package.json is located)
2. npm run setup
3. npm start

The live-server package will fire up a web server and load the application.  Clicking the "Add a font" button will display a random font-awesome icon; clicking the 'x' will remove the icon from the screen.
